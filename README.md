# Qrop

## Introduction

[Qrop](https://qrop.frama.io) is a crop planning and record keeping free
software designed by market gardeners, for market gardeners, with the help of
the wonderful French coop [L'Atelier paysan](https://latelierpaysan.org).

Qrop is available on GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows.

**Warning:** this is alpha software with known bugs. It runs, and work at least
some of the times, but use at your own risk.

## âœ¨ Features

### Plan your season

Define your crop plan: plantings, crop, varieties, bed lengths, spacings,
expected yields... Autogenerate sowing and planting tasks and get seed
quantities, flats to start. Visualize each season of your plan. Easily create,
duplicate, delete, batch-edit, sort and filter successions.

### Keep track of your tasks

Get a week-to-week list of your tasks: sowing, planting, weeding, pruning,
irrigating... Quickly filter overdue, due and done tasks. Track your labor cost
by task.

### Manage your field map and crop rotations

Define your crop map: drag n' drop your plantings on your crop map. Get the crop
history of every single bed to ensure good rotations.

### Take notes and photos

Write notes, take photos and link them to your plantings. In a near future, it
will also be possible to take notes for tasks and locations.

### Track your harvests and crop yields

Keep track of each harvest and get real-time crop yields (planned).

### Seeds and transplants list

Qrop autogenerates a list of the seeds and transplants to buy based on your crop
plan.
